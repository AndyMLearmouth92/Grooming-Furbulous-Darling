# Grooming-Furbulous-Darling

Grooming Furbulous Darling is a custom-designed and responsive site that I built for a client. The site advertises their salon: a bio about the owners, a description of their services with prices, a gallery of happy customers, a widget that links their Facebook reviews and a contact form. I used the client's existing logo and Facebook page to come up a cohesive colour scheme that matched their existing branding. The client was extremely happy with the site and reported an increase in enquiries and bookings.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on creating a sleek and professional site according to my client's specifications.

# Optimisations:
+ If I were to improve this website, I would look into adding an online booking portal rather than relying on the contact form.

# Lessons Learned:
+ Working to a client's specifications.
+ The importance of cohesive and consisent branding (the client already had a well-established Facebook page).
+ Utilising widgets to improve the customer experience (integrating the client's Facebook reviews).
+ Updating the favicon to match the client's logo
+ SEO, Google analytics and hosting to the client's domain (using Google domains).

Note: the site is not currently live as the business is on a hiatus, but please feel free to download the repo to view the site locally.
