					<section>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/stockimg.jpg" alt="" /></span>I cannot remember a time in our lives when a dog has not been a part of our family. Over the years we have had large and small pooches share their lives with us both through the good and bad times. I think that's the thing with dogs, no matter what, they are always there for you. Quite literally man and woman's best friend.</p>
						<p>As with anything life gets in the way and you get swept away with the humdrum of it all. Dawn was 53 when she began training to become a dog groomer and loved every moment of it. So much so that she continued to finesse her trade at the facility in which we both were taught. Nina, on the other hand, had recently completed University and had fallen into a job working for an environmental scientist company, however this was not something she wanted to pursue. Having previously completed an Extended Diploma in Animal Management, working in Environmental Science felt like the furthest thing from working with animals.</p>
						<p>That was when Dawn suggested she explore the possibility of moving into dog grooming, offering some work experience for a few days. It was the opening to a door Nina had been looking for for years. Instantly she felt that she had found her calling. Both spoke about setting up a small place, where dogs would receive one to one attention, with no cages and a garden to play in when the weather allowed it. And so the journey began. In 2019 we opened our doors and since have met some of the most wonderful pooches and people. We are forever grateful to all of our customers and their furry family, both big and small.</p>
